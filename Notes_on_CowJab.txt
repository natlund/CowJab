Default App Technician is useful.  Also useful to be able to set the technician on the AI Visit, independently of setting the App Technician.

Ability to easily add a new bull at point of creating inseminations might be useful.

Wherever a bull appears, also show whether the semen is sexed or not.
Show 'SXD' (in red) for Sexed semen, and blank (nothing) for un-sexed semen.
